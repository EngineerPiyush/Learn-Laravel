After installing the application just check by printing something so go->
resources/views/welcome.blade.php
Note : if we do not give the .blade extention in the view file it will still work.

What is MVC(Model ,View , Controller) ?
MVC is a software design pattern to develop reliable and scallebale software applications.

Model = Write Bussiness Logic and Database communication.
View = UserInterface (code that we we write to display on UI)
Controller : Handle user interaction and select a view to render communicate model and View

M (Model):
Represents the data layer (database tables, relationships, queries).
Example: User, Post, Product.
Defines attributes, relationships, scopes, casts.
Should contain data-related logic only (not business rules).

V (View):
Responsible for the presentation layer (Blade templates, React/Vue components, etc.).

C (Controller):
Handles the application logic.
Receives a request â†’ asks the Model for data â†’ passes data to the View.
Should not contain raw SQL, but can call models/services.


File and Folder Structure Overview :

composer.json : this is the most important file of your project it by mistakly you delete it
chances of running your project is almost impossible.
because all the detils , dependencies and autoload files information here.

Note : The dependencies that are listed on composer.json file are stored inside vender folder.
app / --Controller
      --Model
      --Server Provider
      --Middleware

console.php -- this file is used when we deal with command line interface

config / --database.php(connection for database ad db configration)

database / --migrations
           --seeders
           --factories
public / -- .htaccess
         -- index.php (when we open the website the first file executes public/index.php)

storage / -- app
          -- framework
          -- logs
when we create a file like pdf , exel inside our project it store inside storage folder
also cache logs are stored here.

ðŸ”¹ What is Blade Template in Laravel?

Blade is Laravelâ€™s templating engine.
Itâ€™s a special syntax built on top of plain PHP that helps you write cleaner, reusable,
and more readable views (HTML files).

Blade templates are stored inside the resources/views folder, and have theextension .blade.php.
Example:

resources/views/welcome.blade.php
resources/views/admin/admin.blade.php

ðŸ”¹ Why use Blade?

Instead of mixing raw PHP into your HTML (which looks messy), Blade gives you:

Cleaner syntax â†’ {{ $variable }} instead of <?php echo $variable; ?>
Template inheritance â†’ reuse layouts across pages
Control structures â†’ @if, @foreach, @auth etc.
Components â†’ reusable UI pieces (<x-alert />, <x-button />)
Security â†’ output is automatically escaped (protects against XSS).

When you load a Blade file (.blade.php) for the first time:
Laravel compiles it into a cached PHP file inside storage/framework/views.
After that, Laravel uses the cached PHP file directly.

Component : 
A component is a reusable block of UI + optional logic.
It represents a part of the interface (like a button, card, modal).
It may internally call functions, but its main purpose is UI composition.
Note : --
Both functions and components are reusable, but their scope is different.
A function is about logic reuse (e.g., math, data processing).
A component is about UI reuse (HTML/structure), though it may include small logic.
