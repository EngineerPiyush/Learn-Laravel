After installing the application just check by printing something so go->
resources/views/welcome.blade.php
Note : if we do not give the .blade extention in the view file it will still work.

What is MVC(Model ,View , Controller) ?
MVC is a software design pattern to develop reliable and scallebale software applications.

Model = Write Bussiness Logic and Database communication.
View = UserInterface (code that we we write to display on UI)
Controller : Handle user interaction and select a view to render communicate model and View

M (Model):
Represents the data layer (database tables, relationships, queries).
Example: User, Post, Product.
Defines attributes, relationships, scopes, casts.
Should contain data-related logic only (not business rules).

V (View):
Responsible for the presentation layer (Blade templates, React/Vue components, etc.).

C (Controller):
Handles the application logic.
Receives a request â†’ asks the Model for data â†’ passes data to the View.
Should not contain raw SQL, but can call models/services.


File and Folder Structure Overview :

composer.json : this is the most important file of your project it by mistakly you delete it
chances of running your project is almost impossible.
because all the detils , dependencies and autoload files information here.

Note : The dependencies that are listed on composer.json file are stored inside vender folder.
app / --Controller
      --Model
      --Server Provider
      --Middleware

console.php -- this file is used when we deal with command line interface

config / --database.php(connection for database ad db configration)

database / --migrations
           --seeders
           --factories
public / -- .htaccess
         -- index.php (when we open the website the first file executes public/index.php)

storage / -- app
          -- framework
          -- logs
when we create a file like pdf , exel inside our project it store inside storage folder
also cache logs are stored here.

ðŸ”¹ What is Blade Template in Laravel?

Blade is Laravelâ€™s templating engine.
Itâ€™s a special syntax built on top of plain PHP that helps you write cleaner, reusable,
and more readable views (HTML files).

Blade templates are stored inside the resources/views folder, and have theextension .blade.php.
Example:

resources/views/welcome.blade.php
resources/views/admin/admin.blade.php

ðŸ”¹ Why use Blade?

Instead of mixing raw PHP into your HTML (which looks messy), Blade gives you:

Cleaner syntax â†’ {{ $variable }} instead of <?php echo $variable; ?>
Template inheritance â†’ reuse layouts across pages
Control structures â†’ @if, @foreach, @auth etc.
Components â†’ reusable UI pieces (<x-alert />, <x-button />)
Security â†’ output is automatically escaped (protects against XSS).

When you load a Blade file (.blade.php) for the first time:
Laravel compiles it into a cached PHP file inside storage/framework/views.
After that, Laravel uses the cached PHP file directly.

Component : 
A component is a reusable block of UI + optional logic.
It represents a part of the interface (like a button, card, modal).
It may internally call functions, but its main purpose is UI composition.
Note : --
Both functions and components are reusable, but their scope is different.
A function is about logic reuse (e.g., math, data processing).
A component is about UI reuse (HTML/structure), though it may include small logic.

what are validation rules in Larvel ?
Valiation rules means which type validation you are going to make 
like : reqired , min & max , email , password etc

What are the named routes in laravel ?
Named routes are  nothing but the route which i have named..
means sometimes in laravel we have a long path route and if you want to short the url or 
route in some small words so that you can prevent mistakes by typing routes and also do 
not want to type a long url then you can use named route feature.

Prefix Route group?
When so many routes have some fixed path/route in starting then we group them so that the 
starting path we do not need to type for each path also if there is any change we can do it
eaisly
There are three ways to group a route in Laravel
1: using Prefix
2: using Controller
3: using Middleware

What is Middleware ?
Middleware is a layer between client and application
Client Request->Middleware->Controller/View
suppose if you want to check wheather a user is logged in or not then you can do check the 
session are set or not in each page or u can use middleware which will run before all
controllers.

Types of Middleware
1: Global Middleware
2: Route Middleware
3: Group Middleware

To apply middleware in your laravel project you need to go inside bootstrap/app.php and in 
withMiddleware() function you need to put it.
